            Chopped Salad is a user poem generator, that CHOPS up poems you used
            to make a nice poem salad.
            <br />
            <br />
            I presented a version of ths program made in Python during an event
            at my high school called "Writers Week". A teacher expressed how she
            really liked the program, and she wanted to use this in her own
            classroom.
            <br />
            <br />
            This website is for her and for other teachers, students, and people
            who love poetry.
            <br />
            <br />
